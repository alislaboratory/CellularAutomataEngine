# CellularAutomataEngine

One of my Year 12 Software major projects. An educational application for people to learn about cellular automata by exploring different types.

## Todo

(in sort of priority order)

- Implement object oriented cells so colour can be implemented later on.
- Game rules.
- UI functions.
- Fix so that it doesnt break when mouse leaves grid.
