# CellularAutomataEngine

One of my Year 12 Software major projects. An educational application for people to learn about cellular automata by exploring different types.

## Todo

(in sort of priority order)

- Create a field map grid UI for the field map to be edited.
- Brush up the UI and make it look nicer with some CSS
- Add colours instead of opacity so there is a color range instead of the current opacity. For example low value is red, high value is green, etc
